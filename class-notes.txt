Chapter 7

Psuedo-ops: (google later)
	1  .org opnd=address
	2* .fill opnd=num
	3* .blkw opnd=num -assigns memory three variables
	4* .stringz opnd="characters" -generally ascii, allocates and initializes n+1 words in memory
	5  .end -ends program?
    *can be given label

Labels:
    -can be used in code anywhere with the PCOffset
  Traps:
    HALT=
    IN= 	prints prompt on display, accepts character, echos, stores ASCII code in R0[7:0]
    OUT=	prints whatever is in R0[7:0]
    GETC=	reads character typed and simply puts in R0[7:0]
    PUTS=	prints the string, must have first address of string in R0[7:0]

Example Problem:
 1.    sorting algorithms
	first flowchart
 2. given a null term array of nummbers starting at x3200
    must swag numbers in [15:8] and [7:0]
	x3200	xA012		
	x3201	x6704
	x3202	x2932	->
	x3203	x0041
	x3204	x0000
    for lab: x[68](24) [score](ID)
    ways to switch
	1. add xFF01
	2. add to itself
	3. but must also add a 1 if the bit dropped is a 1
	4. can do this with conditional branch!!
